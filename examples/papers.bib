  abstract             = {In diffusion MRI (dMRI), a good sampling scheme is important for efficient acquisition and robust reconstruction. Diffusion weighted signal is normally acquired on single or multiple shells in q-space. Signal samples are typically distributed uniformly on different shells to make them invariant to the orientation of structures within tissue, or the laboratory coordinate frame. The Electrostatic Energy Minimization (EEM) method, originally proposed for single shell sampling scheme in dMRI, was recently generalized to multi-shell schemes, called Generalized EEM (GEEM). GEEM has been successfully used in the Human Connectome Project (HCP). However, EEM does not directly address the goal of optimal sampling, i.e., achieving large angular separation between sampling points. In this paper, we propose a more natural formulation, called Spherical Code (SC), to directly maximize the minimal angle between different samples in single or multiple shells. We consider not only continuous problems to design single or multiple shell sampling schemes, but also discrete problems to uniformly extract sub-sampled schemes from an existing single or multiple shell scheme, and to order samples in an existing scheme. We propose five algorithms to solve the above problems, including an incremental SC (ISC), a sophisticated greedy algorithm called Iterative Maximum Overlap Construction (IMOC), an 1-Opt greedy method, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) method, and a Constrained Non-Linear Optimization (CNLO) method. To our knowledge, this is the first work to use the SC formulation for single or multiple shell sampling schemes in dMRI. Experimental results indicate that SC methods obtain larger angular separation and better rotational invariance than the state-of-the-art EEM and GEEM. The related codes and a tutorial have been released in DMRITool.},

  abstract  = {Previously, we showed that compressive or compressed sensing (CS) can be used to reduce significantly the data required to obtain 2D-NMR relaxation and diffusion spectra when they are sparse or well localized. In some cases, an order of magnitude fewer uniformly sampled data were required to reconstruct 2D-MR spectra of comparable quality. Nonetheless, this acceleration may still not be sufficient to make 2D-MR spectroscopy practicable for many important applications, such as studying time-varying exchange processes in swelling gels or drying paints, in living tissue in response to various biological or biochemical challenges, and particularly for in vivo MRI applications. A recently introduced framework, marginal distributions constrained optimization (MADCO), tremendously accelerates such 2D acquisitions by using a priori obtained 1D marginal distribution as powerful constraints when 2D spectra are reconstructed. Here we exploit one important intrinsic property of the 2D-MR relaxation exchange spectra: the fact that the 1D marginal distributions of each 2D-MR relaxation exchange spectrum in both dimensions are equal and can be rapidly estimated from a single Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) or inversion recovery prepared CPMG measurement. We extend the MADCO framework by further proposing to use the 1D marginal distributions to inform the subsequent 2D data-sampling scheme, concentrating measurements where spectral peaks are present and reducing them where they are not. In this way we achieve compression or acceleration that is an order of magnitude greater than that in our previous CS method while providing data in reconstructed 2D-MR spectral maps of comparable quality, demonstrated using several simulated and real 2D T2-T2 experimental data. This method, which can be called "informed compressed sensing", is extendable to other 2D- and even ND-MR exchange spectroscopy.},

  abstract  = {Recent advances in diffusion MRI make use of the diffusion signal sampled on the whole Q-space, rather than on a single sphere. While much effort has been done to design uniform sampling schemes for single shell experiment, it is yet not clear how to build a strategy to sample the diffusion signal in the whole Fourier domain. In this article, we propose a method to generate acquisition schemes for multiple Q-shells experiment in diffusion MRI. The acquisition protocols we design are incremental, which means they remain approximately optimal when truncated before the acquisition is complete. Our method is fast, incremental, and we can generate diffusion gradients schemes for any number of acquisitions, any number of shells, and any number of points per shell. The samples arranged on different shells do not share the same directions. The method is tested for Spherical Polar Fourier reconstruction of the diffusion signal, and based on Monte-Carlo simulations, several preferred acquisition parameters are identified.},

  abstract = {Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is the unique technique to infer the microstructure of the white matter in vivo and noninvasively, by modeling the diffusion of water molecules. Ensemble Average Propagator (EAP) and Orientation Distribution Function (ODF) are two important Probability Density Functions (PDFs) which reflect the water diffusion. Estimation and processing of EAP and ODF is the central problem in dMRI, and is also the first step for tractography. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is the most widely used estimation method which assumes EAP as a Gaussian distribution parameterized by a tensor. Riemannian framework for tensors has been proposed successfully in tensor estimation and processing. However, since the Gaussian EAP assumption is oversimplified, DTI can not reflect complex microstructure like fiber crossing. High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging (HARDI) is a category of methods proposed to avoid the limitations of DTI. Most HARDI methods like Q-Ball Imaging (QBI) need some assumptions and only can handle the data from single shell (single $b$ value), which are called as single shell HARDI (sHARDI) methods. However, with the development of scanners and acquisition methods, multiple shell data becomes more and more practical and popular. This thesis focuses on the estimation and processing methods in multiple shell HARDI (mHARDI) which can handle the diffusion data from arbitrary sampling scheme. There are many original contributions in this thesis. -First, we develop the analytical Spherical Polar Fourier Imaging (SPFI), which represents the signal using SPF basis and obtains EAP and its various features including ODFs and some scalar indices like Generalized Fractional Anisotropy (GFA) from analytical linear transforms. In the implementation of SPFI, we present two ways for scale estimation and propose to consider the prior $E(0)=1$ in estimation process. -Second, a novel Analytical Fourier Transform in Spherical Coordinate (AFT-SC) framework is proposed to incorporate many sHARDI and mHARDI methods, explore their relation and devise new analytical EAP/ODF estimation methods. -Third, we present some important criteria to compare different HARDI methods and illustrate their advantages and limitations. -Fourth, we propose a novel diffeomorphism invariant Riemannian framework for ODF and EAP processing, which is a natural generalization of previous Riemannian framework for tensors, and can be used for general PDF computing by representing the square root of the PDF called wavefunction with orthonormal basis. In this Riemannian framework, the exponential map, logarithmic map and geodesic have closed forms, the weighted Riemannian mean and median uniquely exist and can be estimated from an efficient gradient descent. Log-Euclidean framework and Affine-Euclidean framework are developed for fast data processing. -Fifth, we theoretically and experimentally compare the Euclidean metric and Riemannian metric for tensors, ODFs and EAPs. -Finally, we propose the Geodesic Anisotropy (GA) to measure the anisotropy of EAPs, Square Root Parameterized Estimation (SRPE) for nonnegative definite ODF/EAP estimation, weighted Riemannian mean/median for ODF/EAP interpolation, smoothing, atlas estimation. The concept of \emph{reasonable mean value interpolation} is presented for interpolation of general PDF data.},

  abstract  = {Spherical Deconvolution (SD) is commonly used for estimating fiber Orientation Distribution Functions (fODFs) from diffusion-weighted signals. Existing SD methods can be classified into two categories: 1) Continuous Representation based SD (CR-SD), where typically Spherical Harmonic (SH) representation is used for convenient analytical solutions, and 2) Discrete Representation based SD (DR-SD), where the signal profile is represented by a discrete set of basis functions uniformly oriented on the unit sphere. A feasible fODF should be non-negative and should integrate to unity throughout the unit sphere S 2. However, to our knowledge, most existing SH-based SD methods enforce non-negativity only on discretized points and not the whole continuum of S 2. Maximum Entropy SD (MESD) and Cartesian Tensor Fiber Orientation Distributions (CT-FOD) are the only SD methods that ensure non-negativity throughout the unit sphere. They are however computational intensive and are susceptible to errors caused by numerical spherical integration. Existing SD methods are also known to overestimate the number of fiber directions, especially in regions with low anisotropy. DR-SD introduces additional error in peak detection owing to the angular discretization of the unit sphere. This paper proposes a SD framework, called Non-Negative SD (NNSD), to overcome all the limitations above. NNSD is significantly less susceptible to the false-positive peaks, uses SH representation for efficient analytical spherical deconvolution, and allows accurate peak detection throughout the whole unit sphere. We further show that NNSD and most existing SD methods can be extended to work on multi-shell data by introducing a three-dimensional fiber response function. We evaluated NNSD in comparison with Constrained SD (CSD), a quadratic programming variant of CSD, MESD, and an L1-norm regularized non-negative least-squares DR-SD. Experiments on synthetic and real single-/multi-shell data indicate that NNSD improves estimation performance in terms of mean difference of angles, peak detection consistency, and anisotropy contrast between isotropic and anisotropic regions.},

  abstract  = {In diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI), Spherical Deconvolution (SD) is a commonly used approach for estimating the fiber Orientation Distribution Function (fODF). As a Probability Density Function (PDF) that characterizes the distribution of fiber orientations, the fODF is expected to be non-negative and to integrate to unity on the continuous unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$. However, many existing approaches, despite using continuous representation such as Spherical Harmonics (SH), impose non-negativity only on discretized points of $\mathbb{S}^2$. Therefore, non-negativity is not guaranteed on the whole $\mathbb{S}^2$. Existing approaches are also known to exhibit false positive fODF peaks, especially in regions with low anisotropy, causing an over-estimation of the number of fascicles that traverse each voxel. This paper proposes a novel approach, called Non-Negative SD (NNSD), to overcome the above limitations. NNSD offers the following advantages. First, NNSD is the first SH based method that guarantees non-negativity of the fODF throughout the unit sphere. Second, unlike approaches such as Maximum Entropy SD (MESD), Cartesian Tensor Fiber Orientation Distribution (CT-FOD), and discrete representation based SD (DR-SD) techniques, the SH representation allows closed form of spherical integration, efficient computation in a low dimensional space resided by the SH coefficients, and accurate peak detection on the continuous domain defined by the unit sphere. Third, NNSD is significantly less susceptible to producing false positive peaks in regions with low anisotropy. Evaluations of NNSD in comparison with Constrained SD (CSD), MESD, and DR-SD (implemented using L1-regularized least-squares with non-negative constraint), indicate that NNSD yields improved performance for both synthetic and real data. The performance gain is especially prominent for high resolution (1.25 mm)^3 data.},

  abstract  = {High Angular Resolution Imaging (HARDI) can better explore the complex micro-structure of white matter compared to Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). Orientation Distribution Function (ODF) in HARDI is used to describe the probability of the fiber direction. There are two type definitions of the ODF, which were respectively proposed in Q-Ball Imaging (QBI) and Diffusion Spectrum Imaging (DSI). Some analytical reconstructions methods have been proposed to estimate these two type of ODFs from single shell HARDI data. However they all have some assumptions and intrinsic modeling errors. In this article, we propose, almost without any assumption, a uniform analytical method to estimate these two ODFs from DWI signals in q space, which is based on Spherical Polar Fourier Expression (SPFE) of signals. The solution is analytical and is a linear transformation from the q-space signal to the ODF represented by Spherical Harmonics (SH). It can naturally combines the DWI signals in different Q-shells. Moreover It can avoid the intrinsic Funk-Radon Transform (FRT) blurring error in QBI and it does not need any assumption of the signals, such as the multiple tensor model and mono/multi-exponential decay. We validate our method using synthetic data, phantom data and real data. Our method works well in all experiments, especially for the data with low SNR, low anisotropy and non-exponential decay.},

  abstract  = { Background: In Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), Riemannian framework based on Information Geometry theory has been proposed for processing tensors on estimation, interpolation, smoothing, regularization, segmentation, statistical test and so on. Recently Riemannian framework has been generalized to Orientation Distribution Function (ODF) and it is applicable to any Probability Density Function (PDF) under orthonormal basis representation. Spherical Polar Fourier Imaging (SPFI) was proposed for ODF and Ensemble Average Propagator (EAP) estimation from arbitrary sampled signals without any assumption.
Purpose: Tensors only can represent Gaussian EAP and ODF is the radial integration of EAP, while EAP has full information for diffusion process. To our knowledge, so far there is no work on how to process EAP data. In this paper, we present a Riemannian framework as a mathematical tool for such task.
Method: We propose a state-of-the-art Riemannian framework for EAPs by representing the square root of EAP, called wavefunction based on quantum mechanics, with the Fourier dual Spherical Polar Fourier (dSPF) basis. In this framework, the exponential map, logarithmic map and geodesic have closed forms, and weighted Riemannian mean and median uniquely exist. We analyze theoretically the similarities and differences between Riemannian frameworks for EAPs and for ODFs and tensors. The Riemannian metric for EAPs is diffeomorphism invariant, which is the natural extension of the affine-invariant metric for tensors. We propose Log-Euclidean framework to fast process EAPs, and Geodesic Anisotropy (GA) to measure the anisotropy of EAPs. With this framework, many important data processing operations, such as interpolation, smoothing, atlas estimation, Principal Geodesic Analysis (PGA), can be performed on EAP data.
Results and Conclusions: The proposed Riemannian framework was validated in synthetic data for interpolation, smoothing, PGA and in real data for GA and atlas estimation. Riemannian median is much robust for atlas estimation.},

  abstract  = {How to estimate the diffusion Ensemble Average Propagator (EAP) from the DWI signals in q-space is an open problem in diffusion MRI field. Many methods were proposed to estimate the Orientation Distribution Function (ODF) that is used to describe the fiber direction. However, ODF is just one of the features of the EAP. Compared with ODF, EAP has the full information about the diffusion process which reflects the complex tissue micro-structure. Diffusion Orientation Transform (DOT) and Diffusion Spectrum Imaging (DSI) are two important methods to estimate the EAP from the signal. However, DOT is based on mono-exponential assumption and DSI needs a lot of samplings and very large b values. In this paper, we propose Spherical Polar Fourier Imaging (SPFI), a novel model-free fast robust analytical EAP reconstruction method, which almost does not need any assumption of data and does not need too many samplings. SPFI naturally combines the DWI signals with different b-values. It is an analytical linear transformation from the q-space signal to the EAP profile represented by Spherical Harmonics (SH). We validated the proposed methods in synthetic data, phantom data and real data. It works well in all experiments, especially for the data with low SNR, low anisotropy, and non-exponential decay.},

The Renyi entropy $H_{1/2}$ of the ODF can be computed from the GA. Moreover, we present an Affine-Euclidean framework and a Log-Euclidean framework so that we can work in an Euclidean space. As an application, Lagrange interpolation on ODF field is proposed based on weighted Frechet mean. We validate our methods on synthetic and real data experiments.

Spherical Polar Fourier Imaging (SPFI) is a recent model-free multi-shell HARDI method which estimates both EAP and ODF from the diffusion signals with multiple b values. As physical PDFs, ODFs and EAPs are nonnegative definite respectively in their domains $\mathbb{S}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$. However, existing ODF/EAP estimation methods like SPFI seldom consider this natural constraint. Although some works considered the nonnegative constraint on the given discrete samples of ODF/EAP, the estimated ODF/EAP is not guaranteed to be nonnegative definite in the whole continuous domain. The Riemannian framework for ODFs and EAPs has been proposed via the square root parameterization based on pre-estimated ODFs and EAPs by other methods like SPFI. However, there is no work on how to estimate the square root of ODF/EAP called as the wavefuntion directly from diffusion signals. In this paper, based on the Riemannian framework for ODFs/EAPs and Spherical Polar Fourier (SPF) basis representation, we propose a unified model-free multi-shell HARDI method, named as Square Root Parameterized Estimation (SRPE), to simultaneously estimate both the wavefunction of EAPs and the nonnegative definite ODFs and EAPs from diffusion signals. The experiments on synthetic data and real data showed SRPE is more robust to noise and has better EAP reconstruction than SPFI, especially for EAP profiles at large radius.},

  abstract  = {Since Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) cannot describe complex non-Gaussian diffusion process, many techniques, called as single shell High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging (sHARDI) methods, reconstruct the Ensemble Average Propagator (EAP) or its feature Orientation Distribution Function (ODF) from diffusion weighted signals only in single shell. Q-Ball Imaging (QBI) and Diffusion Orientation Transform (DOT) are two famous sHARDI methods. However, these sHARDI methods have some intrinsic modeling errors or need some unreal assumptions. Moreover they are hard to deal with signals from different q-shells. Most recently several novel multiple shell HARDI (mHARDI) methods, including Diffusion Propagator Imaging (DPI), Spherical Polar Fourier Imaging (SPFI) and Simple Harmonic Oscillator based Reconstruction and Estimation (SHORE), were proposed to analytically estimate EAP or ODF from multiple shell (or arbitrarily sampled) signals. These three methods all represent diffusion signal with some basis functions in spherical coordinate and use plane wave formula to analytically solve the Fourier transform. To our knowledge, there is no theoretical analysis and practical comparison among these sHARDI and mHARDI methods. In this paper, we propose a unified computational framework, named Analytical Fourier Transform in Spherical Coordinate (AFT-SC), to perform such theoretical analysis and practical comparison among all these five state-of-the-art diffusion MRI methods. We compare these five methods in both theoretical and experimental aspects. With respect to the theoretical aspect, some criteria are proposed for evaluation and some differences together with some similarities among the methods are highlighted. Regarding the experimental aspect, all the methods are compared in synthetic, phantom and real data. The shortcomings and advantages of each method are highlighted from which SPFI appears to be among the best because it uses an orthonormal basis that completely separates the spherical and radial information. },

  abstract  = {Compressed Sensing (CS) takes advantage of signal sparsity or compressibility and allows superb signal reconstruction from relatively few measurements. Based on CS theory, a suitable dictionary for sparse representation of the signal is required. In diffusion MRI (dMRI), CS methods proposed for reconstruction of diffusion-weighted signal and the Ensemble Average Propagator (EAP) utilize two kinds of Dictionary Learning (DL) methods: 1) Discrete Representation DL (DR-DL), and 2) Continuous Representation DL (CR-DL). DR-DL is susceptible to numerical inaccuracy owing to interpolation and regridding errors in a discretized q-space. In this paper, we propose a novel CR-DL approach, called Dictionary Learning - Spherical Polar Fourier Imaging (DL-SPFI) for effective compressed-sensing reconstruction of the q-space diffusion-weighted signal and the EAP. In DL-SPFI, a dictionary that sparsifies the signal is learned from the space of continuous Gaussian diffusion signals. The learned dictionary is then adaptively applied to different voxels using a weighted LASSO framework for robust signal reconstruction. Compared with the start-of-the-art CR-DL and DR-DL methods proposed by Merlet et al. and Bilgic et al., respectively, our work offers the following advantages. First, the learned dictionary is proved to be optimal for Gaussian diffusion signals. Second, to our knowledge, this is the first work to learn a voxel-adaptive dictionary. The importance of the adaptive dictionary in EAP reconstruction will be demonstrated theoretically and empirically. Third, optimization in DL-SPFI is only performed in a small subspace resided by the SPF coefficients, as opposed to the q-space approach utilized by Merlet et al. We experimentally evaluated DL-SPFI with respect to L1-norm regularized SPFI (L1-SPFI), which uses the original SPF basis, and the DR-DL method proposed by Bilgic et al. The experiment results on synthetic and real data indicate that the learned dictionary produces sparser coefficients than the original SPF basis and results in significantly lower reconstruction error than Bilgic et al.'s method.},

Most works, known as single shell High Angular Resolution Imaging (sHARDI), focus on single shell sampling and reconstruct the Orientation Distribution Function (ODF). The ODF, which has no radial information at all, is just one of features of Ensemble Average Propagator (EAP). Diffusion Spectrum Imaging (DSI) is a standard method to estimate EAP via numerical Fourier Transform (FT), which needs lots of samples and is impractical for clinical study. Spherical Polar Fourier Imaging (SPFI) [1,2] was proposed to represent the signal using SPF basis, then the EAP and the ODF have analytical closed forms. So the estimation of the coefficients under SPF basis is very important. In [1,2], the coefficients are estimated based on a standard Least Square (LS) with L2 norm regularization (L2-L2). In this paper, we propose to estimate the coefficients using LS with L1 norm regularization (L2-L1), also named as Least Absolute Selection and Shrinkage Operator (LASSO). And we prove that the L2-L1 estimation of the coefficients is actually the well known Compressive Sensing (CS) method to estimate EAP, which brings lots of Mathematical tools and possibility to improve the sampling scheme in q-space. },

However, HARDI methods such as Diffusion Spectrum Imaging (DSI) typically require significantly more signal measurements than DTI, resulting in prohibitively long scanning times. One of the goals in HARDI research is therefore to improve estimation of quantities such as the Ensemble Average Propagator (EAP) and the Orientation Distribution Function (ODF) with a limited number of diffusion-weighted measurements. A popular approach to this problem, Compressed Sensing (CS), affords highly accurate signal reconstruction using significantly fewer (sub-Nyquist) data points than required traditionally. Existing approaches to CS diffusion MRI (CS-dMRI) mainly focus on applying CS in the q-space of diffusion signal measurements and fail to take into consideration information redundancy in the k-space. In this paper, we propose a framework, called 6-Dimensional Compressed Sensing diffusion MRI (6D-CS-dMRI), for reconstruction of the diffusion signal and the EAP from data sub-sampled in both 3D k-space and 3D q-space. To our knowledge, 6D-CS-dMRI is the first work that applies compressed sensing in the full 6D k-q space and reconstructs the diffusion signal in the full continuous q-space and the EAP in continuous displacement space. Experimental results on synthetic and real data demonstrate that, compared with full DSI sampling in k-q space, 6D-CS-dMRI yields excellent diffusion signal and EAP reconstruction with low root-mean-square error (RMSE) using 11 times less samples (3-fold reduction in k-space and 3.7-fold reduction in q-space).},

  abstract  = {In diffusion MRI (dMRI), determining an appropriate sampling scheme is crucial for acquiring the maximal amount of information for data reconstruction and analysis using the minimal amount of time. For single-shell acquisition, uniform sampling without directional preference is usually favored. To achieve this, a commonly used approach is the Electrostatic Energy Minimization (EEM) method introduced in dMRI by Jones et al. However, the electrostatic energy formulation in EEM is not directly related to the goal of optimal sampling-scheme design, i.e., achieving large angular separation between sampling points. A mathematically more natural approach is to consider the Spherical Code (SC) formulation, which aims to achieve uniform sampling by maximizing the minimal angular difference between sampling points on the unit sphere. Although SC is well studied in the mathematical literature, its current formulation is limited to a single shell and is not applicable to multiple shells. Moreover, SC, or more precisely continuous SC (CSC), currently can only be applied on the continuous unit sphere and hence cannot be used in situations where one or several subsets of sampling points need to be determined from an existing sampling scheme. In this case, discrete SC (DSC) is required. In this paper, we propose novel DSC and CSC methods for designing uniform single-/multi-shell sampling schemes. The DSC and CSC formulations are solved respectively by Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and a gradient descent approach. A fast greedy incremental solution is also provided for both DSC and CSC. To our knowledge, this is the first work to use SC formulation for designing sampling schemes in dMRI. Experimental results indicate that our methods obtain larger angular separation and better rotational invariance than the generalized EEM (gEEM) method currently used in the Human Connectome Project (HCP).},

However, HARDI methods normally require significantly more signal measurements and a longer scan time than DTI, which limits its clinical utility. By considering sparsity of the diffusion signal, Compressed Sensing (CS) allows robust signal reconstruction from relatively fewer samples, reducing the scanning time. A good dictionary that sparsifies the signal is crucial for CS reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Tensorial Spherical Polar Fourier Imaging (TSPFI) to recover continuous diffusion signal and diffusion propagator by representing the diffusion signal using an orthonormal TSPF basis. TSPFI is a generalization of the existing model-based method DTI and the model-free method SPFI. We also propose dictionary learning TSPFI (DL-TSPFI) to learn an even sparser dictionary represented as a linear combination of TSPF basis from continuous mixture of Gaussian signals. The learning process is efficiently performed in a small subspace of SPF coefficients, and the learned dictionary is proved to be sparse for all mixture of Gaussian signals by adaptively setting the tensor in TSPF basis. Then the learned DL-TSPF dictionary is optimally and adaptively applied to different voxels using DTI and a weighted LASSO for CS reconstruction. DL-TSPFI is a generalization of DL-SPFI, by considering general adaptive tensor setting instead of a scale value. The experiments demonstrated that the learned DL-TSPF dictionary has a sparser representation and lower reconstruction Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) than both the original SPF basis and the DL-SPF dictionary.},

  abstract     = {A good data sampling scheme is important for diffusion MRI acquisition and reconstruction. Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) data is normally acquired on single or multiple shells in q-space. The samples in different shells are typically distributed uniformly, because they should be invariant to the orientation of structures within tissue, or the laboratory coordinate frame. The Electrostatic Energy Minimization (EEM) method, originally proposed for single shell sampling scheme in dMRI by Jones et al., was recently generalized to the multi-shell case, called generalized EEM (GEEM). GEEM has been successfully used in the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Recently, the Spherical Code (SC) concept was proposed to maximize the minimal angle between different samples in single or multiple shells, producing a larger angular separation and better rotational invariance than the GEEM method. In this paper, we propose two novel algorithms based on the SC concept: 1) an efficient incremental constructive method, called Iterative Maximum Overlap Construction (IMOC), to generate a sampling scheme on a discretized sphere; 2) a constrained non-linear optimization (CNLO) method to update a given initial scheme on the continuous sphere. Compared to existing incremental estimation methods, IMOC obtains schemes with much larger separation angles between samples, which are very close to the best known solutions in single shell case. Compared to the existing Riemannian gradient descent method, CNLO is more robust and stable. Experiments demonstrated that the two proposed methods provide larger separation angles and better rotational invariance than the state-of-the-art GEEM and methods based on the SC concept.},

The space of normalized time series with n time points is the unit sphere $S^{n-2}$, named the functional space. Riemannian framework on the sphere, including the geodesic, the exponential map, and the logarithmic map, has been well studied in Riemannian geometry. In this paper, by introducing the Riemannian framework in the functional space, we propose a novel nonparametric robust method, namely Mean Shift Functional Detection (MSFD), to explore the functional space. The first merit of the MSFD is that it does not need many assumptions on data which are assumed in many existing method, e.g. linear addition (GLM, PCA, ICA), uncorrelation (PCA), independence (ICA), the number and the shape of clusters (FCM). Second, MSFD takes into account the spatial information and can be seen as a multivariate extension of the functional connectivity analysis method. It is robust and works well for activation detection in task study even with a biased activation reference. It is also able to find the functional networks in resting-state study without a user-selected "seed" region. Third, it can enhance the boundary between different functional networks. Experiments were conducted on synthetic and real data to compare the performance of the proposed method with GLM and ICA. The experimental results validated the accuracy and robustness of MSFD, not only for activation detection in task study but also for functional network exploration in resting-state study. },

In the framework, the covariance matrices of image features in the five modes are used to represent object appearance. Since a nonsingular covariance matrix is a SPD matrix lying on a connected Riemannian manifold, the Log-Euclidean Riemannian metric is used for statistics on the covariance matrices of image features. Further, we present an effective online Log-Euclidean Riemannian subspace learning algorithm which models the appearance changes of an object by incrementally learning a low-order Log-Euclidean eigenspace representation through adaptively updating the sample mean and eigenbasis. Tracking is then led by the Bayesian state inference framework in which a particle filter is used for propagating sample distributions over the time. Theoretic analysis and experimental evaluations demonstrate the promise and effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

Our work provides an efficient analytical solution to estimate, from few measurements, the diffusion propagator at any radius.

  abstract  = {Brain morphometry based classification from magnetic resonance (MR) acquisitions has been widely investigated in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In the literature, a morphometric representation of brain structures is obtained by spatial normalization of each image into a common space (i.e., a pre-defined atlas) via non-linear registration, thus the corresponding regions in different brains can be compared. However, representations generated from one single atlas may not be sufficient to reveal the underlying anatomical differences between the groups of disease-affected patients and normal controls (NC). In this article, we propose a different methodology, namely the multi-atlas based morphometry, which measures morphometric representations of the same image in different spaces of multiple atlases. Representations generated from different atlases can thus provide the complementary information to discriminate different groups, and also reduce the negative impacts from registration errors. Specifically, each studied subject is registered to multiple atlases, where adaptive regional features are extracted. Then, all features from different atlases are jointly selected by a correlation and relevance based scheme, followed by final classification with the support vector machine (SVM). We have evaluated the proposed method on 459 subjects (97 AD, 117 progressive-MCI (p-MCI), 117 stable-MCI (s-MCI), and 128 NC) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, and achieved 91.64% for AD/NC classification and 72.41% for p-MCI/s-MCI classification. Our results clearly demonstrate that the proposed multi-atlas based method can significantly outperform the previous single-atlas based methods.},

The aim of this article is to propose a penalized multiscale adaptive regression model (PMARM) framework to spatially and adaptively infer the orientation distribution function (ODF) of water diffusion in regions with complex fiber configurations. In PMARM, we reformulate the HARDI imaging reconstruction as a weighted regularized least-square regression (WRLSR) problem. Similarity and distance weights are introduced to account for spatial smoothness of HARDI, while preserving the unknown discontinuities (e.g., edges between white matter and gray matter) of HARDI. The L1 penalty function is introduced to ensure the sparse solutions of ODFs, while a scaled L1 weighted estimator is calculated to correct the bias introduced by the L1 penalty at each voxel. In PMARM, we integrate the multiscale adaptive regression models, the propagation-separation method, and Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) to adaptively estimate ODFs across voxels. Experimental results indicate that PMARM can reduce the angle detection errors on fiber crossing area and provide more accurate reconstruction than standard voxel-wise methods.

However, these methods only utilize information from local neighborhoods, neglecting useful information from remote voxels. In this paper, we propose a novel image SR method that integrates both local and global information for effective image recovery. This is achieved by, in addition to TV, low-rank regularization that enables utilization of information throughout the image. The optimization problem can be solved effectively via alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Experiments on MR images of both adult and pediatric subjects demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the details in the recovered high-resolution images, and outperforms methods such as the nearest-neighbor interpolation, cubic interpolation, iterative back projection (IBP), non-local means (NLM), and TV-based up-sampling.},

  abstract     = {Most natural images can be approximated using their low-rank components. This fact has been successfully exploited in recent advancements of matrix completion algorithms for image recovery. However, a major limitation of low-rank matrix completion algorithms is that they cannot recover the case where a whole row or column is missing. The missing row or column will be simply filled as an arbitrary combination of other rows or columns with known values. This precludes the application of matrix completion to problems such as super-resolution (SR) where missing values in many rows and columns need to be recovered in the process of up-sampling a low-resolution image. Moreover, low-rank regularization considers information globally from the whole image and does not take proper consideration of local spatial consistency. Accordingly, we propose in this paper a solution to the SR problem via simultaneous (global) low-rank and (local) total variation (TV) regularization. We solve the respective cost function using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Experiments on MR images of adults and pediatric subjects demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the details of the recovered high-resolution images, and outperforms the nearest-neighbor interpolation, cubic interpolation, non-local means, and TV-based up-sampling.},

  abstract  = {Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) provides invaluable information in white matter microstructure and is widely applied in neurological applications. However, DWI is largely limited by its relatively low spatial resolution. In this paper, we propose an image post-processing method, referred to as super-resolution reconstruction, to estimate a high spatial resolution DWI from the input low-resolution DWI, e.g., at a factor of 2. Instead of requiring specially designed DWI acquisition of multiple shifted or orthogonal scans, our method needs only a single DWI scan. To do that, we propose to model both the blurring and downsampling effects in the image degradation process where the low-resolution image is observed from the latent high-resolution image, and recover the latent high-resolution image with the help of two regularizations. The first regularization is four-dimensional (4D) low-rank, proposed to gather self-similarity information from both the spatial domain and the diffusion domain of 4D DWI. The second regularization is total variation, proposed to depress noise and preserve local structures such as edges in the image recovery process. Extensive experiments were performed on 20 subjects, and results show that the proposed method is able to recover the fine details of white matter structures, and outperform other approaches such as interpolation methods, non-local means based upsampling, and total variation based upsampling.},

In the literature, different subjects are often compared in one atlas space, which may be insufficient in revealing complex brain changes. In this paper, instead of deploying one atlas for feature extraction and classification, we propose a maximum-margin based representation learning (MMRL) method to learn the optimal representation from multiple atlases. Unlike traditional methods that perform the representation learning separately from the classification, we propose to learn the new representation jointly with the classification model, which is more powerful in discriminating AD patients from normal controls (NC). We evaluated the proposed method on the ADNI database, and achieved 90.69% for AD/NC classification and 73.69% for p-MCI/s-MCI classification.},

  abstract     = {Neonatal images have low spatial resolution and insufficient tissue contrast. Generally, interpolation methods are used to upsample neonatal images to a higher resolution for more effective image analysis. However, the resulting images are often blurry and are susceptible to partial volume effect. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that utilizes longitudinal prior information for effective super-resolution reconstruction of neonatal images. We use a non-local approach to learn the spatial relationships of brain structures in high-resolution longitudinal images and apply this information to the super-resolution reconstruction of the neonatal image. In other words, the recurring patterns throughout the longitudinal scans are leveraged for reconstructing the neonatal image with high resolution. To solve this otherwise ill-posed inverse problem, low-rank and total-variation regularizations are enforced. Experiments performed on both T1- and T2-weighted MR images of 28 neonates demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of recovering more structural details and outperforms methods such as nearest neighbor interpolation, spline-based interpolation, non-local means upsampling, and both low-rank and total variation based super-resolution},

  abstract  = {Since the 1980s, diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique has been widely used to track the effective diffusion of water molecules, which is hindered by many obstacles (e.g., fibers or membranes), in the human brain in vivo. Because water molecules tend to diffuse slowly across white matter fibers and diffuse fast along such fibers, the use of dMRI to track water diffusion allows one to map the microstructure and organization of those white matter pathways (17). Quantitatively measuring the diffusion process is critical for a quantitative assessment of the integrity of anatomical connectivity in white matter and its association with brain functional connectivity. Its clinical applications include normal brain maturation and aging, cerebral ischemia, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, metabolic disorders, and brain tumors, among many others. Although there are several nice review papers and monographies on dMRI (15, 5, 101, 81), this chapter was written for the readers who are interested in the theoretical underpinning of various mathematical and statistical methods associated with dMRI. Due to limitations of space, we are unable to cite all important papers in the dMRI literature. },

Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is a non-invasive way to study the anatomy of brain networks. Here, we review the principles of dMRI, its methodologies, and some of its clinical applications for the Brainnetome. Future research in this field is discussed.},
